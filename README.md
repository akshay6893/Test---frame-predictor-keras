# Test---frame-predictor-keras

This is a test code for my new frame prediction project for anomoly detection.
This code is in keras and was just made to see that the idea of predicting frame from 
previous frames works or not.
Convlstms from the keras libraries were used with a u-netish structure.
I plan to further develop this project in pytorch.
